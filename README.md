# FinalProject

## To-Do List
### This project aims to use sqlite3 databases to make To-Do lists. With that, a user would be able to add, remove, edit/modify the tasks, and edit the status of the tasks (such as marking them as completed, stuck, work in progress...) There is also an -h function added.
